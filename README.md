# 🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction System

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts the likelihood of **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson’s Disease** using Machine Learning models trained on real-world medical datasets.

## 🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates the power of ML in the medical field by allowing users to input patient data and receive disease predictions in real time. The app features an easy-to-use UI, quick predictions, and modular code design.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predicts 3 diseases: **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, and **Parkinson's**
- 🧠 Uses trained **ML classification models**
- ⚡ Instant predictions with **<1 second load time**
- 🖥️ Built with **Streamlit** for a simple and clean interface
- 🧩 Modular design – easily expandable to other diseases

## 📊 Model Performance

| Disease       | Algorithm Used     | Accuracy |
|---------------|--------------------|----------|
| Diabetes      | Logistic Regression| 78%      |
| Heart Disease | Random Forest      | 85%      |
| Parkinson’s   | SVM                | 88%      |
